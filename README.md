## Design Choices

### Fonts

For my fonts I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to search for a font that would suit the aesthetic of my website. From my search, I have decide to use two font styles. The first font is called [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?query=Lora). This font is for the main font for all content inforamtion. Reasons for using this font are it been not to stylised and having a simple readable decor. The second font is called [Arvo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo?query=arvo). This font is for all the headers and navigation bar. Reasons for using this font are having a differential style to Lora, so it can stand from the main content although it can compliment to it as well.

### Icons

I have use Icons from [Font Awesome Library](https://fontawesome.com/[) and [Flagicons](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/). The icons from Font Awesome are more for visual reprensation of socail media links and decor to resemble visual style for differrnt part of content ie flag, trophy and medals. The icons used from Flagicons will be more widely use throught the website for the purpose of indiacating the nationality of rider and where the team is based. It will also reprents the country where the races are taking place in.

### Colors 

I used [Encycolorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/) to pick out colors for my website. The main color I used throught the website was electric lime #ccff00 a color that is synonymous to fans of Moto GP that represent the color of Valentino Rossi leather's and bike fairings. To complement this color I used jet black #0A0A0A which scores a high contrast ratio on [Webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=CCFF00&bcolor=0A0A0A). Using these two colors that work in function in reverse of foreground and background the user will not have diffcult experience of viewing the inforamtion of the website. I used blue lightning #3393FF for hover effect on the navigation bar, the tables, the social inks and the submit button. It was also implement on borders to distinguise different section of content. All of the rest of the colors that I used were to represnt the podium posistion for 1st(gold #D4AF37), 2nd(silver #C0C0C0), 3rd(bronze #cd7f32) and retired(violet #EE82EE)

### Stucture

I built my website by desktop size first and then downsized it to the smallest screen size of a Samsung Galaxy Fold (280px) 

|Screen Size  | Breakpoint |
|-------------|------------|
|x-small      |  420px     |
|small        |  570px     |
|large        |  1330px    |
|x-large      |  1548px    |
|x-x-large    |  1770px    |

# Testing

From testing the site, overall I feel the goal that I set out were met. The site is responsive to small devices(Galaxy fold, Iphone), medium devices (Ipad, Galaxy Tab), large devices(laptop, desktop.). Images size appropriately to the screen sizes staying in it aspect ratio and looking clear. Section stay center through responsive with layout staying consistent. The inforamtion is up to date and resembles the needs of the user.

Problem's that I experience during testing.

I had to add an extra media query of max-width 1770px to fix an issues of the annotaion table not staying inline with constructor table that would happen when the screen width  went below 1770px.

I added grid posistion to my form content for better reponsive after testing with standard box model wasnt effiecent enough.
