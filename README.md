## Design Choices

### Fonts

For my fonts, I have used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to search for a font that would suit the aesthetic of my website. From my search, I have decided to use two font styles. The first font is called [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?query=Lora). This font is for the main font for all content information. The reasons for using this font are it has been not too stylized  and has a simple readable decor. The second font is called [Arvo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Arvo?query=arvo). This font is for all the headers and navigation bars. Reasons for using this font are having a different style to Lora, so it can stand from the main content although it can complement it as well.

### Icons

I have used Icons from [Font Awesome Library](https://fontawesome.com/[) and [Flagicons](https://flagicons.lipis.dev/). The icons from Font Awesome are more for a visual representation of social media links and decor to resemble visual style for different part of the content ie flag, trophy and medals. The icons used from Flagicons will be more widely used through the website for indicating the nationality of the rider and where the team is based. It will also represent the country where the races are taking place in.

### Colors 

I used [Encycolorpedia](https://encycolorpedia.com/) to pick out colors for my website. The main color I used through  the website was electric lime #ccff00 a color that is synonymous to fans of Moto GP that represent the color of Valentino Rossi leathers  and bike fairings. To complement this color I used jet black #0A0A0A which scores a high contrast ratio on [Webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/?fcolor=CCFF00&bcolor=0A0A0A). Using these two colors that work in function in reverse of foreground and background the user will not have difficult experience viewing the information of the website. I used blue lightning #3393FF for the hover effect on the navigation bar, the tables, the social inks, and the submit button. It was also implemented on borders to distinguish different sections of content. All of the rest of the colors that I used were to represent the podium positions for 1st(gold #D4AF37), 2nd(silver #C0C0C0), 3rd(bronze #cd7f32) and retired(violet #EE82EE).

### Structure

I built my website by desktop size first and then downsized it to the smallest screen size of a Samsung Galaxy Fold (280px) 

|Screen Size  | Breakpoint |
|-------------|------------|
|x-small      |  420px     |
|small        |  610px     |
|medium       |  800px     |
|large        |  970px     |
|x-large      |  1330px    |
|x-x-large    |  1548px    |

### Tables

The table section gives a detailed account of the rider championship table and the constructor championship. The rider table will give information on all riders and how many points were scored in each race. All points will be totaled to determine their place in the table. Colors of gold, silver, and bronze will determine podium place and violet will mean retired(did not finish races). P and F will also partner with the rider placement who accomplish the requirements.  An annotation table will give meaning to pole position, fastest lap, and retired. The constructor table will demonstrate the same function of the rider except it has been for the manufacturers. A hover effect can be used on the table to highlight the row that is being viewed for ease of tracking the information.      

![Table Section](wireframe/table-section.png)

# Testing

From testing the site, overall I feel the goal that I set out was met. The site is responsive to small devices(Galaxy fold, iPhone), medium devices (Ipad, Galaxy Tab), and large devices(laptop, desktop.). Images size appropriately to the screen sizes staying in their aspect ratio and looking clear. Section stays center through responsive with layout staying consistent. The information is up to date and resembles the needs of the user.


The problems that I experience during testing.

+ I had to add an extra media query of max-width 1770px to fix issues of the annotation table not staying in line with the constructor table that would happen when the screen width went below 1770px.

+ I added grid position to my form content for better reponsive after testing with the standard box model wasn't efficient enough.

+ I restructured my main content's flex from originally being flex-wrap on a larger screen to changing it to a grid and column flex hybrid. I used flew wrap on rows and flex-basis on the column so it would be better responsive on a larger screen. It would switch to the column on a smaller screen with a media query. This was also implemented in the rider section.

+ At first, during testing, I taught the table was responsive when sized but with further inspection, it was not. To fix the problem I added a scroll to the rider championship table and the constructor table.

+  When deploying my site to GitHub pages, I encountered the problem of my stylesheet not linking to my Html. The problem occurred from my assets folder being capitalized. I first change the "a" to uppercase so It would link, but sticking to the industry standard of having the directory in lowercase. I use the git command of git mv case-sensitive tmp,git mv tmp CaseSensitive to fix the problem.

+ Error's I encountered when I ran my HTML through validator w3 was using the <bold> element in my <th> element which is by default already a style of the element. Adding px to my width and height img tags, leaving my ACTION in my FORM element empty, and leaving my SRCSET empty in my img tag. To fix this error I deleted all the inappropriate values that were needed. [Result](wireframe/html%20validator.png "W3C HTML") 

+ Error's I encountered when I ran my CSS through validator w3 jigsaw were reorganizing my overflow rule last in the upcoming section, spell checks in my .nav-menu, and deleting a word-break rule that was deprecated. I have 5 warnings for vendor extension. [Result](wireframe/css%20validator.png "W3C CSS")

\
&nbsp;

## Unfixed Bugs 

A bug that I encountered was having a margin on the left or right of a table that was in the scroll. If I had a margin on when the scroll appeared on the lower screen size the table would overflow out of the margin set impending the visual of the start row and the end row. To compromise I turned off the margin left and right for visual structure inconsistency.
